# The Shifted Dimension

The Shifted Dimension is my latest project, an open-world Saints Row 4 style Unreal Engine 4 game. It is completely free and open-source, and licensed under Apache License 2, just like ShiftOS-Next.

I'm putting the repo in the /shiftosnext/ organization because it is related to ShiftOS-Next, and ShiftOS, in the way that the story continues off from the ending of the original ShiftOS story created by Philip Adams.

Future updates will be posted in this readme.
